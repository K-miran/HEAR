# List of Changes

## Version 3.4.5

- Fixed a concurrency issue in SEALNet: the `unordered_map` storing `SEALContext` pointers was
not locked appropriately on construction and destruction of new `SEALContext` objects.
- Fixed a few typos in examples ([PR 71](https://github.com/microsoft/SEAL/pull/71)).
- Added include guard to config.h.in.

## Version 3.4.4

- Fixed issues with `SEALNet.targets` file and `SEALNet.nuspec.in`.
- Updated `README.md` with information about existing multi-platform
[NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Research.SEALNet).

## Version 3.4.3

- Fixed bug in .NET serialization code where an incorrect number of bytes was written when using
ZLIB compression.
- Fixed an issue with .NET functions `Encryptor.EncryptSymmetric...`, where asymmetric encryption
was done instead of symmetric encryption.
- Prevented `KeyGenerator::galois_keys` and `KeyGenerator::relin_keys` from being called when the
encryption parameters do not support keyswitching.
- Fixed a bug in `Decryptor::invariant_noise_budget` where the computed noise budget was
`log(plain_modulus)` bits smaller than it was supposed to be.
- Removed support for Microsoft GSL `gsl::multi_span`, as it was recently deprecated in GSL.

## Version 3.4.2

- Fixed bug reported in [Issue 66](https://github.com/microsoft/SEAL/issues/66) on GitHub.
- CMake does version matching now (correctly) only on major and minor version, not patch version,
so writing `find_package(SEAL 3.4)` works correctly and selects the newest version `3.4.x` it can
find.

## Version 3.4.1

This patch fixes a few issues with ZLIB support on Windows. Specifically,

- Fixed a mistake in `native/src/CMakeConfig.cmd` where the CMake library search path
suffix was incorrect.
- Switched to using a static version of ZLIB on Windows.
- Corrected instructions in [README.md](README.md) for enabling ZLIB support on Windows.

## Version 3.4.0

### New Features

- Microsoft SEAL can use [ZLIB](https://github.com/madler/zlib), a data compression library,
to automatically compress data that is serialized. This applies to every serializable object
in Microsoft SEAL. This feature must be enabled by the user. See more explanation of the compression
mechanism in [README.md](README.md#zlib). Microsoft SEAL does not redistribute ZLIB.
- AES-128 is replaced with the BLAKE2 family of hash functions in the pseudorandom number generator,
as BLAKE2 provides better cross-platform support. Microsoft SEAL redistributes the
[reference implementation of BLAKE2](https://github.com/BLAKE2/BLAKE2)
with light modifications to silence some misleading warnings in Visual Studio. The reference
implementation of BLAKE2 is licensed under
[CC0 1.0 Universal](https://github.com/BLAKE2/BLAKE2/blob/master/COPYING); see license boilerplates
in files [native/src/seal/util/blake*](native/src/seal/util/).
- The serialization functionality has been completely rewritten to make it more safe and robust.
Every serialized Microsoft SEAL object starts with a 16-byte `Serialization::SEALHeader` struct,
and then includes the data for the object member variables. Every serializable object can now also
be directly serialized into a memory buffer instead of a C++ stream. This improves serialization
for .NET and makes it much easier to wrap the serialization functionality in other languages, e.g.,
Java. Unfortunately, old serialized Microsoft SEAL objects are incompatible with the new format.
- A ciphertext encrypted with a secret key, for example, a keyswitching key, has one component
generated by the PRNG. By using a seeded PRNG, this component can be replaced with the random seed
used by the PRNG to reduce data size. After transmitted to another party with Microsoft SEAL, the
component can be restored (regenerated) with the same seed. The security of using seeded PRNG is
enhanced by switching to BLAKE2 hash function with a 512-bit seed.
- `Encryptor` now can be constructed with a secret key. This enables symmetric key encryption which
has methods that serialize ciphertexts (compressed with a seed) to a C++ stream or a memory buffer.
- The CMake system has been improved. For example, multiple versions of Microsoft SEAL can now be
installed on the same system easily, as the default installation directory and library filename now
depend on the version of Microsoft SEAL. Examples and unit tests can now be built without installing
the library. [README.md](README.md) has been updated to reflect these changes.
- `Encryptor::encrypt` operations in the BFV scheme are modified. Each coefficient of a plaintext
message is first multiplied with the ciphertext modulus, then divided by the plaintext modulus, and
rounded to the nearest integer. In comparison with the previous method, where each coefficient of a
plaintext message is multiplied with the flooring of the coefficient modulus divided by the plaintext
modulus, the new method reduces the noise introduced in encryption, increases a noise budget of a
fresh encryption, slightly slows down encryption, and has no impact on the security at all.

- Merged [PR 62](https://github.com/microsoft/SEAL/pull/62) that uses a non-adjacent form (NAF)
decomposition of random rotations to perform them in a minimal way from power-of-two rotations in
both directions. This improves performance of random rotations.

### API Changes

#### C++ Native

In all classes with `save` and `load` methods:
- Replaced the old `save` with two new methods that saves to either a C++ stream or a memory buffer.
Optionally, a compression mode can be chosen when saving an object.
- Replaced the old `load` with two new methods that loads from either a C++ stream or a memory buffer.
- Added a method `save_size` to get an upper bound on the size of the object as if it was written to
an output stream. To save to a buffer, the user must ensure that the buffer has at least size equal
to what the `save_size` member function returns.
- New `save` and `load` methods rely on the `Serialization` class declared in `serialization.h`.
This class unifies the serialization functionality for all serializable Microsoft SEAL classes.

In class `Ciphertext`:
- Added a method `int_array` for read-only access to the underlying `IntArray` object.
- Removed methods `uint64_count_capacity` and `uint64_count` that can now be accessed in a more
descriptive manner through the `int_arrar` return value.

In class `CKKSEncoder`: added support for `gsl::span` type of input.

In class `SEALContext::ContextData`: added method `coeff_mod_plain_modulus` for read-only access to
the non-RNS version of `upper_half_increment`.

In class `EncryptionParameters`: an `EncryptionParameters` object can be constructed without
`scheme_type` which by default is set to `scheme_type::none`.

In class `Encryptor`:
- An `Encryptor` object can now be constructed with a secret key to enable symmetric key encryption.
- Added methods `encrypt_symmetric` and `encrypt_zero_symmetric` that generate a `Ciphertext` using
the secret key.
- Added methods `encrypt_symmetric_save` and `encrypt_zero_symmetric_save` that directly serialize
the resulting `Ciphertext` to a C++ stream or a memory buffer. The resulting `Ciphertext` no long
exists after serilization. In these methods, the second polynomial of a ciphertext is generated by
the PRNG and is replaced with the random seed used.

In class `KeyGenerator`:
- Added methods `relin_keys_save` and `galois_keys_save` that generate and directly serialize keys
to a C++ stream or a memory buffer. The resulting keys no long exist after serilization. In these
methods, half of the polynomials in keys are generated by the PRNG and is replaced with the random
seed used.
- Methods `galois_keys` and `galois_keys_save` throw an exception if `EncryptionParameters` do not
support batching in the BFV scheme.

In class `Plaintext`: added a method `int_array` for read-only access to the underlying `IntArray`
object.

In class `UniformRandomGenerator` and `UniformRandomGeneratorFactory`: redesigned for users to
implement their own random number generators more easily.

In file `valcheck.h`: validity checks are partitioned into finer methods; the `is_valid_for(...)`
functions will validate all aspects fo the Microsoft SEAL ojects.

New classes `BlakePRNG` and `BlakePRNGFactory`: uses Blake2 family of hash functions for PRNG.

New class `Serialization`:
- Gives a uniform serilization in Microsoft SEAL to save objects to a C++ stream or a memory buffer.
- Can be configured to use ZLIB compression.

#### .NET

API changes are mostly identical in terms of functionality to those in C++ native, except only
the `IsValidFor` variant of the validity check functions is available in .NET, the more granular
checks are not exposed.

New files:
- [dotnet/src/Serialization.cs](dotnet/src/Serialization.cs)

### Minor Bug and Typo Fixes

- Function `encrypt_zero_asymmetric` in [native/src/seal/util/rlwe.h](native/src/seal/util/rlwe.h)
handles the condition `is_ntt_form == false` correctly.
- Invariant noise calculation in BFV is now correct when the plaintext modulus is large and
ciphertexts are fresh (reported in [issue 59](https://github.com/microsoft/SEAL/issues/59)).
- Fixed comments in [native/src/seal/util/smallntt.cpp](native/src/seal/util/smallntt.cpp) as
reported in [issue 56](https://github.com/microsoft/SEAL/issues/56).
- Fixed an error in examples as reported in [issue 61](https://github.com/microsoft/SEAL/issues/61).
- `GaloisKeys` can no longer be created with encryption parameters that do not support batching.
- Security issues in deserialization were resolved.

## Version 3.3.2 (patch)

### Minor Bug and Typo Fixes

- Switched to using RNS rounding instead of RNS flooring to fix the CKKS
accuracy issue reported in [issue 52](https://github.com/microsoft/SEAL/issues/52).
- Added support for QUIET option in CMake (`find_package(seal QUIET)`).
- Using `[[nodiscard]]` attribute when compiling as C++17.
- Fixed a bug in `Evaluator::multiply_many` where the input vector was changed.

## Version 3.3.1 (patch)

### Minor Bug and Typo Fixes

- A bug was fixed that introduced significant extra inaccuracy in CKKS when
compiled on Linux, at least with some versions of glibc; Windows and macOS
were not affected.
- A bug was fixed where, on 32-bit platforms, some versions of GCC resolved
the util::reverse_bits function to the incorrect overload.

## Version 3.3.0

### New Features

In this version, we have significantly improved the usability of the CKKS
scheme in Microsoft SEAL and many of these improvements apply to the BFV
scheme as well. Homomorphic operations that are based on key switching,
i.e., relinearization and rotation, do not consume any noise budget (BFV)
or impact accuracy (CKKS). The implementations of these operations are
significantly simplified and unified, and no longer use bit decomposition,
so decomposition bit count is gone. Moreover, fresh ciphertexts now have
lower noise. These changes have an effect on the API and it will
be especially worthwhile for users of older versions of the library to study
the examples and comments in
[native/examples/3_levels.cpp](native/examples/3_levels.cpp) (C++) or
[dotnet/examples/3_Levels.cs](dotnet/examples/3_Levels.cs) (C#).

The setup of `EncryptionParameters` has been made both easier and safer
(see [API Changes](#api-changes) below).

The examples in [native/examples/](native/examples/) and
[dotnet/examples/](dotnet/examples/) have been redesigned to better teach
the multiple technical concepts required to use Microsoft SEAL correctly and
efficiently, and more compactly demonstrate the API.

### API Changes

Deleted header files:
- native/defaultparameters.h

New header files:
- [native/src/seal/kswitchkeys.h](native/src/seal/kswitchkeys.h): new base
class for `RelinKeys` and `GaloisKeys`)
- [native/src/seal/modulus.h](native/src/seal/modulus.h): static helper
functions for parameter selection
- [native/src/seal/valcheck.h](native/src/seal/valcheck.h): object validity check
functionality
- [native/src/seal/util/rlwe.h](native/src/seal/util/rlwe.h)

In class `SEALContext`:
- Replaced `context_data(parms_id_type)` with `get_context_data(parms_id_type)`;
- Removed `context_data()`;
- Added `key_context_data()`, `key_parms_id()`, `first_context_data()`, and
`last_context_data()`;
- Added `using_keyswitching()` that indicates whether key switching is supported
in this `SEALContext`;
- `Create(...)` in C++, and constructor in C#, now accepts an optional security
level based on
[HomomorphicEncryption.org](https://HomomorphicEncryption.org) security standard,
causing it to enforce the specified security level. By default a 128-bit
security level is used.
- Added `prev_context_data()` method to class `ContextData` (doubly linked modulus
switching chain);
- In C# `SEALContext` now has a public constructor.

Parameter selection:
- Removed the `DefaultParams` class;
- Default `coeff_modulus` for the BFV scheme are now accessed through the function
`CoeffModulus::BFVDefault(...)`. These moduli are not recommended for the CKKS scheme;
- Customized `coeff_modulus` for the CKKS scheme can be created using
`CoeffModulus::Create(...)` which takes the `poly_modulus_degree` and a vector of
bit-lengths of the prime factors as arguments. It samples suitable primes close to
2^bit_length and returns a vector of `SmallModulus` elements.
- `PlainModulus::Batching(...)` can be used to sample a prime for `plain_modulus`
that supports `BatchEncoder` for the BFV scheme.

Other important changes:
- Removed `size_capacity` function and data members from `Ciphertext` class;
- Moved all validation methods such as `is_valid_for` and `is_metadata_valid_for`
to `valcheck.h`;
- Removed argument `decomposition_bit_count` from methods `relin_keys(...)` and
`galois_keys(...)` in class `KeyGenerator`;
- It is no longer possible to create more than one relinearization key. This is
to simplify the API and reduce confusion. We have never seen a real use-case where
more relinearization keys would be a good idea;
- Added methods to generate an encryption of zero to `Encryptor`;
- Added comparison methods and primality check for `SmallModulus`;
- Classes `RelinKeys` and `GaloisKeys` are now derived from a common base class
`KSwitchKeys`;
- GoogleTest framework is now included as a Git submodule;
- Numerous bugs have been fixed, particularly in the .NET wrappers.
